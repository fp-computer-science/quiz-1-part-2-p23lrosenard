Create a program that serves as the framework for character creation in a new sci-fi RPG. Be sure it meets the following requirements:

#### __Part 1 - Name Your Character__
Create a variable to store the player's name and set it equal to a name (Example. `Yoda`). Display a message that includes the player's and welcomes them to the game.

#### __Part 2 - Choose Your Class__
Create a variable that stores the player's class. Assume the player can choose from the following classes: `Jedi`, `Bounty Hunter`, or `Sith`.

#### __Part 3 - What Does This Mean?__
Create variables to store values for the player's attack, defence, and special abilities based on the following information:

__Jedi__ have an attack equal to 2 times their base attack, a defence equal to 3 times their base defence, and their special ability is called `Jedi mind trick`.

__Bounty Hunters__ gain +2 attack for each enemy they are fighting and lose -5 from their defence if they are fighting more than 3 enemies. Their special ability is called `Jetpack`.

__Sith__ attack grows exponentially based on how many enemies they are fighting. If they are fighting a Jedi, their defense drops by half, otherwise, it drops by one quarter. Their special ability is `Force choke`.

#### __Part 4 - Combat__
Create a combat experience. Assume the player is attacking a certain number of enemies. Create a way to determine if they win or lose that compares their attack and defence to their opponent(s) attack, defence, and how many enemies the player is fighting.
